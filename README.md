6/11 made routes for about

  -- don't forget to: npm install react-router-dom

I installed amCharts to provide this heat map functionality.

If you want to use it, you'll have to:

npm install @amcharts/amcharts4

npm install @amcharts/amcharts4-geodata

before it'll work

Plus, remember it's already been deployed to heroku.com, so to start it you don't use npm start any more, you use 

##npm run dev##
